 Screen Time Analysis Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize personal or aggregated screen time usage across different mobile applications. This project aims to provide meaningful insights into digital habits, helping users better understand and manage their time.

 Project Overview
 This project processes app usage data (minutes used, number of app opens, notifications received) and provides visual analytics to understand:
- Daily screen time trends
- Most used apps
- Notification frequency
- Peak usage hours
- Time-of-day engagement

 Features
- Daily, weekly, and monthly screen time trends
- Analysis of notifications and frequency of app usage
- Identification of most time-consuming apps
- Time-of-day engagement heatmaps
- Custom filters and slicers to analyze user-specific behaviors
- Dynamic and interactive visuals using DAX measures and Power Query

 Tools & Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query – for data loading, cleaning, and transformation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated measures and KPIs
- CSV/Excel – input data format

Dataset Structure
The dashboard uses a structured dataset with the following columns:

| Column Name        | Description                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Date`             | Date of usage                            |
| `App`              | Application name                         |
| `Usage (Minutes)`  | Total screen time per app                |
| `Notifications`    | Number of notifications received         |
| `Times Opened`     | Number of times app was opened           |

 How to Use
1. Open Power BI Desktop
2. Load your dataset via CSV or Excel (use your own or sample data).
3. Navigate through the report pages to explore screen time patterns.
4. Use slicers and filters to view specific days, apps, or usage types.
5. Save and export the report as PDF or publish to the Power BI service (optional).

  Key Insights Provided
- Are specific apps consuming most of your day?
- Do notifications correlate with frequent app checking?
- What times of the day do you use your phone the most?
- How balanced is your app usage over time?

 Learning Outcomes
- Data cleaning and transformation with Power Query
- Creating custom measures using DAX
- Building interactive visuals and dashboards in Power BI
- Identifying behavioral patterns through data analysis
